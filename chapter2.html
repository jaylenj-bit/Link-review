<h2>French Fries</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>What are they</h3></li>
  <p>
    A French fry, often regarded as a quintessential comfort food, is a slender, golden-brown strip of potato that has been expertly cut, typically from whole, starchy potatoes. 
    Each fry boasts a crisp, golden exterior that crackles delicately when bitten into, revealing a fluffy, tender interior that melts in the mouth.

  <li><h3>Best french fry country (according to google)</h3></li>
  <p>
    Even if they didn't actually invent the French fry, Belgians probably do make the world's best. 
    Incidentally, fries have two names in this country too. They're called “frieten” in the northern Dutch-speaking 
    part of the country and “frites” in the French-speaking south. Belgian fries.
